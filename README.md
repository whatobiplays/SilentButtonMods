# Silent Button Mods
This repository has the 3MF files for the devices featured in my silent button mod video.

## Printing
I've already made the height adjustments to the specs in my video, so these are ready to print.

I recommend setting your slicer to print `by object` instead of `by layer` (which is the default). This will reduce stringing since the print head won't have to travel to a different ring between layers. These rings are so small you won't have to worry about the print head hitting another ring. 

## Contributing

The `handhelds` folder has the files for each device. If there is a device you don't see here, feel free to open a pull request to add your 3MF file.
